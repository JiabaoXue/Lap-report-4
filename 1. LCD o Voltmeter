  The goal of this program is to read a voltage from analog pin A0, convert the 

  reading into a voltage, and display that voltage on an LCD 

  screen.

  //Floating point numbers are not exact, and may yield strange results when compared. For example 9.0 / 0.3 may not quite equal 30.0. You should instead check that the absolute value of the difference between the numbers is less than some small number.  

  // When using float, you always need a decimal.  

  // print out the value you read:
